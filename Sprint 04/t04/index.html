                            <li>The action unfolds around several characters traveling through parallel worlds, because,
                                as it turned out, the world in which we live is far from the only place. Incredible,
                                deadly passions play out here, and the existence of several worlds is at stake. A
                                shooter named Roland Descene, the last of an ancient knightly line, hunts down the Man
                                in Black, whose real name is Walter O'Dim. This is not just a fight or enmity, but a
                                true confrontation, which is an eternal struggle between good and evil. Both heroes seek
                                to find the mysterious Dark Tower that protects the worlds from the forces of chaos. In
                                no case should Roland be allowed to let his sworn enemy get to her first, for the
                                villain's goal is to destroy the tower, which will lead to monstrous consequences. Only
                                Descene is able to stop Walter and prevent the realization of his nightmare plans.
                                However, in reality, where everything is changeable, and a lot of dangers await at every
                                corner, this turns out to be far from an easy mission.

                            <li>The wealthy and successful detective novelist Harlan Trombie celebrates his 85th
                                birthday with his family. At the party, he argues with almost everyone about money,
                                business and other things. In the morning, his corpse is found with his throat cut in
                                his own bedroom, and all the relatives present are under suspicion. Charming private
                                detective Benoit Blanc, hired by an anonymous author, is taken up to investigate. The
                                detective soon realizes that the key to unraveling the mystery of the writer's death is
                                Martha, Harlan's nurse who suffers from an illness that makes her sick when she lies.
