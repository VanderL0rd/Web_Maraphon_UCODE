            <h2>Who is Hulk?</h2>

            <p>
                Dr. Bruce Banner is a brilliant nuclear physicist, but in an accident he is caught in an extremely
                strong
                gamma radiation. As a result, he develops into a large, green creature with superhuman powers. Whenever
                Banner becomes angry he turns into the Hulk. Over the years, there were different types of the comic
                Hulks.
                The most popular is the Savage Hulk, with little intelligence and great anger. In addition, there are
                the
                horrors Hulk, also known as Joe Fixit, Merged Hulk or The Professor and the Devil Hulk. All these Hulks
                represent certain aspects of the personality of Bruce Banner.
            </p>

            <h2>Super personnel and equipment</h2>

            <p>
                Hulk is not a proper superhero. Especially as Savage Hulk, he is uncontrollable and has relentless
                destructive
                power. As Savage Hulk he can lift 100 tons at least. As Bruce Banner is he is an ordinary man with
                extraordinary
                intellectual abilities. However Banner suffers from the recurrent transformations.
            </p>

            <h2>The Hulk universe</h2>

            <p>
                Bruce Banner rarely stays in one place, since the demon in him comes out and leaves nothing but
                devastation.
                Through this, he meets many people and is in lots of new situations. Since Banner is always in fear a
                transformation into Hulk, he is very cautious and trusts few people. Nevertheless, he can not prevent
                regularly
                turning into the Hulk.
            </p>
            <h2>Hulks enemies and friends</h2>

            <p>The Abomination is the strongest opponent of the Hulks. In general, it is people behaving badly and thus
                angering banner. One nemesis is The Leader. Over the years, the Hulk has faced many opponents from other
                baddies of the Marvel Comics universe, for example Blastaar, the live bomb or Bi-Beast. In addition, the
                Hulk is regularly hunted by the military.
                Allies are the She-Hulk Hulk, Banners cousin actually caused by a blood transfusion to the Hulk. His
                closest
                friends are Rick Jones and Jim Wilson. An important role is played by the psychologist Dr. Leonard
                Samson
                who helps calm Banner.</p>

            <h2>The History of Comics</h2>

            <p> Hulk was created in 1962 by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee. In the first edition the Hulk was still gray, but
                because of technical reasons this color didnâ€™t work and they choose the uncommon colour of green. Hulk
                was
                originally limited to six issues, but because of the many fans, mostly college students he gave numerous
                guest appearances. He was given a permanent place in the series "The Avengers". After a few more years,
                he
                continued independently. It appeared until 1999. Then a new Hulk Marvel comic was started.
                From 1986 until almost the end of the first series, Peter David was the writer for 140 issues. He
                changed
                the relationship between Banner and the Hulk and invented the different forms of title character. Since
                then, the Hulk is yet to return to old strength with the fans.</p>
