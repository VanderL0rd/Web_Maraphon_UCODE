        What makes a superhero?
    </h2>
    <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability
        to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order
        to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than
            any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use
        that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a
        fireman could be considered a superhero. For instance, a good guy
        fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective
        story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower
        who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy
        is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t
        accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.<br><br>

        <br><br>Hulk<br><br>
        Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays saving the life of Rick Jones
        during the detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed
        into the Hulk when subjected to emotional stress, at or against his will,
        often leading to destructive rampages and conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life.
